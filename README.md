TopCaliber Among Us Bot
![TC Among Us Logo](https://github.com/BSweet16/Among-Us-Bot/blob/master/assets/AmongUsBot.png)
====================
This bot allows for a text channel to only be visible to pairs in a paired voice channel. This could be useful in many applications, however I thought this would be especially useful for streamers who want to give the lobby code to their friends without showing/saying it on stream.<br/>
More features to come in the future!<br/><br/>


Installation
====================
This bot uses DiscordAPI v12.<br/>
